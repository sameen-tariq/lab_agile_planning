As a registered user,
I need to reset my password if I forget it,
So that I can regain access to my account without contacting support.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin syntax):
Given I am on the login page,
When I click on the "Forgot Password" link,
Then I should be taken to a page to enter my email address.

Given I have entered a valid registered email,
When I submit the form,
Then I should receive an email with a reset link.

Given I click the link in my email,
When I open the reset password page,
Then I should be able to set a new password.

Given I submit a new valid password,
When the form is accepted,
Then I should be redirected to the login page with a confirmation message.
